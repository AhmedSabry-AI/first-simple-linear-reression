This is my first machine learning project, where I learned the principles of linear regression and applied them to this dataset. 
I sourced the data from the Kaggle website, which provided a diverse and reliable platform for real-world datasets. Through this project,
I gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, modeling, and interpreting results to extract meaningful insights.
